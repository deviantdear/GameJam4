CPI211 Game Jam #4
#Unity 3D video game made with assets from the Asset store.

#Cycles is a single player 3rd person shooter where you play all the stages of a chicken. 
First you are an egg, you need to crack the egg and then you are transported to the Farm where you fight wolves as a chick and level up your chick to a chicken, then to a monster chicken and then once you level up far enough you win the game and repeat the cycle by laying a giant egg.

#I do not own the all the rights to the assets so you may not use those freely. They are to demonstrate the fucntionality of the code
